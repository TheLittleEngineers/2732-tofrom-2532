# 2732-tofrom-2532
This product is intended to allow a 2732 EPROM to be placed into a 2532 EPROM socket or a 2532 EPROM to be placed into a 2732 EPROM socket. The original product seems to have been placed on github at this url: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/2732-to-2532. Being involved in the original creation of the product, I decided not to fork that repository for this new, slightly improved version, but rather chose to create a new repository. The product is now licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) IN MEMORY OF MY FATHER, ROBERT EMBRY TURNER. I LOVE YOU DADDY! REST IN PEACE.
